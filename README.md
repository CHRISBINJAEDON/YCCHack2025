## 🔥 Overview

WildGuard AI is a student-led invention designed to reduce human–wildlife conflict using ethical AI, IoT, and blockchain technology. Built by a youth team from Sacred Heart International School, Tamil Nadu, India, this smart torch helps villagers deter wild animals safely and log incidents transparently.

## 🌱 Problem Statement

In forest-edge communities, wild animal intrusions threaten lives, crops, and livestock—especially at night. Traditional deterrents like fire and crackers are dangerous, polluting, and often ineffective. WildGuard AI offers a safer, smarter alternative.

## 🚨 What It Does

- Emits **red LED flashes**, **artificial flame visuals**, and **eco-friendly sound effects** to deter animals
- Designed for **instant use** during emergencies
- Future upgrades include:
  - **AI-powered motion detection**
  - **Species recognition**
  - **Smart alerts via mobile app**
  - **Blockchain-based incident logging** for forest departments and NGOs

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Hardware**: Red LED arrays, sound modules, flame-simulation visuals
- **Power**: Rechargeable battery with ergonomic casing
- **Tech Stack**:
  - `TensorFlow Lite` for AI motion detection
  - `Arduino` for hardware control
  - `Ethereum/IPFS` for blockchain logging
  - `React Native` (planned) for mobile app interface
  -## ⚙️ How It Works

WildGuard Torch is an eco-friendly, rechargeable deterrent device designed to protect communities from stray and wild animal threats. It operates without producing smoke or harmful gases, making it safe for both humans and the environment.

### 🔋 Power & Portability
- Rechargeable via standard ports
- Designed for low-maintenance, long-term use
- Suitable for deployment in forest edges, rural zones, and urban streets

### 🚨 Activation Sequence
**On switching on the device:**
- 🔴 A bright red LED array flashes from the front
- 🔊 A loud sound module activates simultaneously
- 🔥 Flame visuals simulate threat deterrence (non-combustive)
- ⚡ All components are triggered instantly to create a multi-sensory deterrent effect

This coordinated response is designed to startle and repel animals without causing harm, making it ideal for ethical wildlife management and urban safety.

### 🐕 Initial Field Test
As a first deployment, the device was used to drive away stray street dogs that posed a threat to pedestrians. The test confirmed its effectiveness in real-world conditions, validating its potential for broader use in wildlife-prone areas.

## 🌐 Scalability & Adaptability

The WildGuard Torch is designed for deployment across diverse terrains and climatic conditions. Its modular hardware and software architecture allow for easy upgrades using the latest technologies, making it adaptable to forest edges, rural zones, and disaster-prone regions. Whether in humid jungles, dry grasslands, or mountainous terrain, the device remains effective and resilient.

## 📊 Performance Indicators & Feedback Framework

To ensure real-world effectiveness, the device will be distributed to communities living near forest areas. Performance will be evaluated based on user feedback, including:

- 📡 Effective range of deterrence
- 🐾 Types of wild animals repelled
- 🔁 Frequency and reliability of alerts
- 🛠️ Suggestions for improvement

This feedback loop will guide iterative enhancements to the device’s design, AI behavior, and alert mechanisms—ensuring it evolves with community needs and environmental challenges.
## 🌍 Global Impact Potential

The Smart Chrome AI Hub and WildGuard Torch are designed to scale across diverse environments—from rural villages and wildlife parks to disaster-prone zones and urban safety networks. By combining privacy-first AI, real-time alerts, and decentralized incident logging, this system empowers communities to respond faster, safer, and smarter. Whether deployed to prevent human-wildlife conflict in India, monitor safety in remote schools in Africa, or assist emergency responders in flood zones, the platform adapts to local needs while contributing to global resilience and SDG advancement.
