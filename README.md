## 🔥 Overview

WildGuard AI is a student-led invention designed to reduce human–wildlife conflict using ethical AI, IoT, and blockchain technology. Built by a youth team from Sacred Heart International School, Tamil Nadu, India, this smart torch helps villagers deter wild animals safely and log incidents transparently.

## 🌱 Problem Statement

In forest-edge communities, wild animal intrusions threaten lives, crops, and livestock—especially at night. Traditional deterrents like fire and crackers are dangerous, polluting, and often ineffective. WildGuard AI offers a safer, smarter alternative.

## 🚨 What It Does

- Emits **red LED flashes**, **artificial flame visuals**, and **eco-friendly sound effects** to deter animals
- Designed for **instant use** during emergencies
- Future upgrades include:
  - **AI-powered motion detection**
  - **Species recognition**
  - **Smart alerts via mobile app**
  - **Blockchain-based incident logging** for forest departments and NGOs

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Hardware**: Red LED arrays, sound modules, flame-simulation visuals
- **Power**: Rechargeable battery with ergonomic casing
- **Tech Stack**:
  - `TensorFlow Lite` for AI motion detection
  - `Arduino` for hardware control
  - `Ethereum/IPFS` for blockchain logging
  - `React Native` (planned) for mobile app interface

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

- Simulating fire and sound deterrents without pollution
- Ensuring effectiveness across species and weather conditions
- Designing for portability, safety, and affordability
- Integrating AI and blockchain while keeping costs low

## 🏆 Achievements

- Created India’s first AI-ready wildlife deterrent torch
- Field-tested with villagers for real-world validation
- Aligned with **UN SDGs**: 3 (Health), 9 (Innovation), 11 (Resilience), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Biodiversity)


## 📚 What We Learned

- Ethical tech design must balance human safety and biodiversity
- Community feedback is essential for real-world impact
- Youth-led innovation can scale globally when aligned with SDGs

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate AI motion detection (TensorFlow Lite)
- [ ] Develop species recognition model
- [ ] Launch mobile app with smart alerts
- [ ] Deploy blockchain logging via Ethereum/IPFS
- [ ] Build village-wide safety networks
- [ ] Prepare for global deployment
## 🌍 Global Impact Potential

The Smart Chrome AI Hub and WildGuard Torch are designed to scale across diverse environments—from rural villages and wildlife parks to disaster-prone zones and urban safety networks. By combining privacy-first AI, real-time alerts, and decentralized incident logging, this system empowers communities to respond faster, safer, and smarter. Whether deployed to prevent human-wildlife conflict in India, monitor safety in remote schools in Africa, or assist emergency responders in flood zones, the platform adapts to local needs while contributing to global resilience and SDG advancement.
