## 🔥 Overview

WildGuard AI is a student-led invention designed to reduce human–wildlife conflict using ethical AI, IoT, and blockchain technology. Built by a youth team from Sacred Heart International School, Tamil Nadu, India, this smart torch helps villagers deter wild animals safely and log incidents transparently.

## 🌱 Problem Statement

In forest-edge communities, wild animal intrusions threaten lives, crops, and livestock—especially at night. Traditional deterrents like fire and crackers are dangerous, polluting, and often ineffective. WildGuard AI offers a safer, smarter alternative.

## 🚨 What It Does

- Emits **red LED flashes**, **artificial flame visuals**, and **eco-friendly sound effects** to deter animals
- Designed for **instant use** during emergencies
- Future upgrades include:
  - **AI-powered motion detection**
  - **Species recognition**
  - **Smart alerts via mobile app**
  - **Blockchain-based incident logging** for forest departments and NGOs

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Hardware**: Red LED arrays, sound modules, flame-simulation visuals
- **Power**: Rechargeable battery with ergonomic casing
- **Tech Stack**:
  - `TensorFlow Lite` for AI motion detection
  - `Arduino` for hardware control
  - `Ethereum/IPFS` for blockchain logging
  - `React Native` (planned) for mobile app interface

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

- Simulating fire and sound deterrents without pollution
- Ensuring effectiveness across species and weather conditions
- Designing for portability, safety, and affordability
- Integrating AI and blockchain while keeping costs low

## 🏆 Achievements

- Created India’s first AI-ready wildlife deterrent torch
- Field-tested with villagers for real-world validation
- Aligned with **UN SDGs**: 3 (Health), 9 (Innovation), 11 (Resilience), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Biodiversity)
- Selected for **AsterHacks 2025** and **Youth Coders Hack 2025**

## 📚 What We Learned

- Ethical tech design must balance human safety and biodiversity
- Community feedback is essential for real-world impact
- Youth-led innovation can scale globally when aligned with SDGs

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate AI motion detection (TensorFlow Lite)
- [ ] Develop species recognition model
- [ ] Launch mobile app with smart alerts
- [ ] Deploy blockchain logging via Ethereum/IPFS
- [ ] Build village-wide safety networks
- [ ] Prepare for global deployment
